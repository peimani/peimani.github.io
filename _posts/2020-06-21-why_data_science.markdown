They say 'Open yourself up to the universe and it will guide you'.  You could say the universe led me here or maybe it was just dumb luck. While I have observed many people joining these boot camps coming from different backgrounds, they all have an individual journey. Here is my story.

As far as I can remember, I always wanted a career where I could make a difference. I thought what could be a better way than to go into healthcare.  Directly working with people to help them get better and even save their lives; seemed to be like a very noble profession.  After finishing school I was hired immediately to work in my dream job, working as a Level 1 Trauma Intensive Care Unit. 

While working with patients there came many instances where they became violent towards me.  I thought I could handle it until I met my match. One day while helping a patient he grabbed my scrubs and pulled me forward.  My back was injured and two surgeries later, I am trying to recover.  While waiting on my surgeries I took a job working in the Quality Department of my hospital.  When I entered the department I realized just how big of a mess things were. I started to develop programs and databases for the hospital to help them.  I used a lot of YouTube videos to teach me how.  The administration was impressed with my computer abilities so they hired me as a Data Analyst.  I enjoyed developing tools and analyzing data to improve how we treat patients and improve their quality of care.  My doctors told me that I could no longer work on the floor with patients because my back could not take another injury.

While learning to be a data analyst I started exploring knowing more about databases. This led me to ask questions about data base management. I took some free courses online and found that this was very interesting. After speaking to some friends who were in the programming fields I started to research a more structured approach and that's when I found out about Data Science.  When learning about this field I was intriqued and impressed with the opportunities available. But most importantly, I felt like this is a skill which can be used to make a difference.

So, here I am. While challenging, I am enjoying learning this skill and look forward to changing the world one line of code at a time.
