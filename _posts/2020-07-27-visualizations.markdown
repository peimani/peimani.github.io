The bar graph, or histogram is beautiful in its simplicity.  It can convey information clearly and in a way that most audiences can interpret.  When I am looking at a couple of variables or just want to be pointed in the right direction with my data, I turn to a histogram.

But when the message you want to convey has more variables or is more difficult to convey, this may not be your visual of choice.


A recent visual I was able to code in Python was a map!!  I was impressed that this visual included a map that could show house sales.  But I was doubly impresssed when I could click on a dot and it would give me information on that house.

The problem I can see with this is that it takes a lot of power to run and may slow things up. Also, being able to put a lot of information can make it too complicated to interpret.

I look forward to learning more beautiful and informative visuals as I progress.
